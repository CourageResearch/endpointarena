# Endpoint Arena Go-To-Market Launch Brief

## 1) Wedge and Positioning

### Category
AI-powered FDA catalyst intelligence for biotech investors.

### Positioning Statement
Endpoint Arena helps biotech investors make better FDA catalyst decisions by tracking out-of-sample AI predictions on real upcoming approvals, surfacing model agreement/disagreement, and monitoring probability shifts over time.

### Why This Wedge First
- Clear buyer pain: binary FDA outcomes move stocks sharply.
- Existing product fit: you already track upcoming decisions, model predictions, confidence, reasoning, and market-like probability movement.
- Faster monetization path than broad “AI benchmark platform.”

## 2) Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

## ICP A: Independent Biotech Catalyst Traders
- Profile: Retail/pro traders focused on event-driven biotech.
- Team size: 1 person.
- Spend tolerance: $39-$149/month.
- Pain: Hard to prioritize which catalysts matter and when sentiment is changing.
- Buying trigger: New catalyst cycle, recent loss, or desire for a repeatable process.
- Win condition: “This saves me time and helps me avoid bad setups.”

## ICP B: Small Biotech Funds and Pods
- Profile: Specialist biotech hedge funds, family offices, or pods.
- Team size: 2-15.
- Spend tolerance: $500-$3,000/month.
- Pain: Need repeatable, auditable signal layer for catalyst prep.
- Buying trigger: Need differentiated process and faster weekly prep.
- Win condition: “This improves our decision process and research coverage.”

## ICP C: Research Desks / Newsletter Operators
- Profile: Independent research shops and premium biotech newsletter writers.
- Team size: 1-5.
- Spend tolerance: $99-$999/month.
- Pain: Need structured content and defensible calls before events.
